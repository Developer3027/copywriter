    <p class="text-center pb-4">
      LKM Creative is a team of broadly expreienced copywriters, helping business grow all around the world - from our humble headquarters in Johannesburg, South Africa.

    <p class="text-center pb-4">
      LKM (short for Lauren Kirsty Meikle) started when founder, Lauren, wanted to use her writing skills to make a difference for businesses far and wide - especially small teams in need of affordable copywriting to tell their story and increase online conversions.
